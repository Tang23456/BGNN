AB  - The incidence of metabolic syndrome is significantly higher in patients with 
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Gut 
      microbiota is causatively linked with the development of both metabolic 
      dysfunctions and gastrointestinal disorders, thus gut dysbiosis in IBS may 
      contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome. Here, we show that human gut 
      bacterium Ruminococcus gnavus-derived tryptamine and phenethylamine play a 
      pathogenic role in gut dysbiosis-induced insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes 
      (T2D) and IBS. We show levels of R. gnavus, tryptamine, and phenethylamine are 
      positively associated with insulin resistance in T2D patients and IBS patients. 
      Monoassociation of R. gnavus impairs insulin sensitivity and glucose control in 
      germ-free mice. Mechanistically, treatment of R. gnavus-derived metabolites 
      tryptamine and phenethylamine directly impair insulin signaling in major 
      metabolic tissues of healthy mice and monkeys and this effect is mediated by the 
      trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 
      (ERK) signaling axis. Our findings suggest a causal role for 
      tryptamine/phenethylamine-producers in the development of insulin resistance, 
      provide molecular mechanisms for the increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome 
      in IBS, and highlight the TAAR1 signaling axis as a potential therapeutic target 
      for the management of metabolic syndrome induced by gut dysbiosis.
