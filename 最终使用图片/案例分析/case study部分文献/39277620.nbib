AB  - Metformin is the most commonly prescribed medication for treating type 2 diabetes 
      (T2D). It is known that metformin can alter the gut microbiome, which influences 
      the effectiveness of metformin treatment. We posited that if the gut microbiome, 
      a reservoir of the resistome, is altered, then the resistome should change as 
      well. To test this hypothesis, we reanalyzed microbiome data generated by Wu et 
      al. (Nat Med 23(7):850-858, 2017), identifying antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) 
      and bacterial species. Through read-based analysis, we observed that the 
      abundance of ARGs indeed changed in many samples treated with metformin. 
      Moreover, the altered pattern was sufficiently heterogeneous across individual 
      samples to allow subcategorization. We also found a strong correlation between 
      the abundance of multidrug-resistant ARGs (MDR-ARGs) and the presence of E. coli. 
      The contig-based analysis led to the same conclusion: an increase in MDR-ARGs due 
      to metformin was associated with an increase in E. coli. In relation to this, we 
      were able to confirm that the majority of MDR-ARGs are likely to originate from 
      E. coli. These results suggest that metformin may have the potential side effect 
      of increasing E. coli carrying ARGs, particularly MDR-ARGs, which could be a 
      concern in T2D therapy that relies on metformin.
