AB  - BACKGROUND: The elevated mortality rate associated with non-small-cell lung 
      cancer (NSCLC) is a well-established global concern. Considerable attention has 
      been directed toward exploring the association between gut microbiota and various 
      malignant tumors. We herein investigated the associations between the intestinal 
      microbiome and its metabolites, particularly short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), in 
      patients with NSCLC at different stages, including early and brain metastasis 
      (BM) stages. The findings aim to offer a fresh perspective on the diagnosis and 
      management of NSCLC. METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from 115 participants, 
      comprising healthy controls (n = 35) and patients with treatment-naive NSCLC at 
      the early stage (ELC, n = 40) and the BM stage (n = 40). Characterization of the 
      intestinal microbiome and fecal SCFA levels was performed using 16S rRNA gene 
      sequencing and gas chromatography. RESULTS: The microbial diversity in patients 
      with NSCLC was found to be less abundant and uniform, particularly in the BM 
      stage. Significant alterations in the community structure of the gut microbiota 
      were observed in patients with NSCLC, with an increase in pathogens in 
      Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria and a decrease in SCFA-producing bacteria in 
      Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, particularly in the BM stage. Meanwhile, microbial 
      communities displayed intricate associations in patients with NSCLC. A biomarker 
      panel (Faecalibacterium, Bifidobacterium, Butyricicoccus, Klebsiella, 
      Streptococcus, and Blautia) successfully distinguished patients in the ELC and BM 
      stages from healthy controls (area under the curve: 0.884). The overall 
      concentration of fecal SCFAs was significantly lower in patients with BM compared 
      to patients with ELC and healthy controls. Subgroup analysis of acetate and 
      butyrate yielded similar results. Moreover, multiple disrupted pathways in the 
      NSCLC group were identified using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
      annotation, including lipid metabolism and genetic information processing, 
      specifically in the BM stage. CONCLUSION: Compared with healthy controls, 
      distinct host-microbe interactions were evident in different phases of patients 
      with NSCLC. Furthermore, specific forms of the gut microbiome and SCFAs may serve 
      as valuable biomarkers and therapeutic targets in the diagnosis and treatment of 
      NSCLC.
