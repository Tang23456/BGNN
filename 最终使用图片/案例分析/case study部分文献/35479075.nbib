AB  - BACKGROUND: Inherited susceptibility and environmental carcinogens are crucial 
      players in lung cancer etiology. The lung microbiome is getting rising attention 
      in carcinogenesis. The present work sought to investigate the microbiome in lung 
      cancer patients affected by familial lung cancer (FLC) and indoor air pollution 
      (IAP); and further, to compare host gene expression patterns with their 
      microbiome for potential links. METHODS: Tissue sample pairs (cancer and adjacent 
      nonmalignant tissue) were used for 16S rRNA (microbiome) and RNA-seq (host gene 
      expression). Subgroup microbiome diversities and their matched gene expression 
      patterns were analyzed. Significantly enriched taxa were screened out, based on 
      different clinicopathologic characteristics. RESULTS: Our FLC microbiome seemed 
      to be smaller, low-diversity, and inactive to change; we noted microbiome 
      differences in gender, age, blood type, anatomy site, histology type, TNM stage 
      as well as IAP and smoking conditions. We also found smoking and IAP dramatically 
      decreased specific-OTU biodiversity, especially in normal lung tissue. 
      Intriguingly, enriched microbes were in three categories: opportunistic 
      pathogens, probiotics, and pollutant-detoxication microbes; this third category 
      involved Sphingomonas, Sphingopyxis, etc. which help degrade pollutants, but may 
      also cause epithelial damage and chronic inflammation. RNA-seq highlighted IL17, 
      Ras, MAPK, and Notch pathways, which are associated with carcinogenesis and 
      compromised immune system. CONCLUSIONS: The lung microbiome can play vital roles 
      in carcinogenesis. FLC and IAP subjects were affected by fragile lung epithelium, 
      vulnerable host-microbes equilibrium, and dysregulated immune surveillance and 
      response. Our findings provided useful information to study the triple interplay 
      among environmental carcinogens, population genetic background, and diversified 
      lung microbiome.
