AB  - The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increasing worldwide, with many 
      patients developing long-term complications that affect their cardiovascular, 
      urinary, alimentary, and other systems. A growing body of literature has reported 
      the crucial role of gut microbiota in metabolic diseases, one of which, 
      Akkermansia muciniphila, is considered the "next-generation probiotic" for 
      alleviating metabolic disorders and the inflammatory response. Although extensive 
      research has been conducted on A. muciniphila, none has summarized its regulation 
      in T2D. Hence, this review provides an overview of the effects and multifaceted 
      mechanisms of A. muciniphila on T2D and related diseases, including improving 
      metabolism, alleviating inflammation, enhancing intestinal barrier function, and 
      maintaining microbiota homeostasis. Furthermore, this review summarizes dietary 
      strategies for increasing intestinal A. muciniphila abundance and effective 
      gastrointestinal delivery.
